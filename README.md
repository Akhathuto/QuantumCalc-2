## Running the Application (Local & Deployment)

This project is a static web application. It uses modern browser features but requires a local server for development due to security policies (CORS). **You cannot open the `index.html` file directly from your filesystem.**

### Local Development

1.  **Get the Code**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2.  **Run a Server**: From the project's root directory, start a local web server. Here are some easy options:
    -   **Using `npx serve` (Easiest)**: If you have Node.js, run `npx serve` in your terminal and open the provided `localhost` URL.
    -   **VS Code Live Server**: Use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code. Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    -   **Python Server**: Run `python -m http.server` (for Python 3) and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Deployment

To deploy QuantumCalc, simply upload all the project files to any static web hosting service (like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.). No build step is necessary.

-   **Build Command:** Set to empty.
-   **Output Directory:** Set to the root directory.

## Configuring AI Features (Gemini API Key)

The AI-powered features in QuantumCalc (like the Formula Explorer and Currency Forecast) are powered by the Google Gemini API.

For these features to work, the application administrator must configure a Google Gemini API key as an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`) in the deployment environment. The application is designed to securely access this key without any action required from the end-user.

If the AI features are not working, it means the API key has not been configured in the environment where the application is hosted. The rest of the application will continue to function normally.
